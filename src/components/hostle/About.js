          Founded in 1997, our journey began with  a simple idea: to
          create a haven for  wanderers, where cultures converge,
          friendships   flourish,
         and memories are made. Over the years,
           we've welcomed countless guests, each adding a unique
          chapter to our story. From backpackers to
          
          solo explorers, families, and groups  of friends, everyone finds
          a place
           in our eclectic and inclusive environment.
